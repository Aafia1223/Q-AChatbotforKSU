In fact, since the 1970s, marketing activities have become among the basic activities of any non-profit organization, whether they are governmental organizations (service ministries) or non-profit civil society organizations such as charities. Marketing is a science and art that is related to all the marketing research and studies that organizations need that precede the production of a good or service. This is with the aim of identifying the needs and desires of the target audience, and it also has a relationship with all the organization’s activities that follow the production of the good or service, such as: promotion activities, distribution activities, development and design activities of the product, and pricing activities. Marketing is the cornerstone of the success of any organization, as most of the concerns of the marketing function are originally directed to caring for the customer, serving him, and working to satisfy him. The importance of the role that marketing plays in preserving the organization's customers has clearly emerged, especially in the era of globalization and the educated consumer who is aware of the options before him and intense competition. King Saud University has realized the necessity of establishing a marketing department within its development plans. The marketing path was changed from being part of the Department of Business Administration to an independent department within the departments of the College of Business Administration, hoping from God Almighty for help and success in achieving the goals and aspirations of this department.",

The department has continued to grow and expand, both in terms of student enrollment and faculty, as well as in the development of its academic programs and foundational courses. With the kingdom's economic and urban growth, and the increasing demand for architects and planners, the department was elevated to an independent College of Architecture and Planning in 1404/1405 AH (1984/1985 AD). The Department of Architecture and Building Sciences awards its graduates the degree of Bachelor of Architecture upon successful completion of 170 credit hours and sixty days of field training. The Department’s program is dedicated to the design studio education process that employs project-based learning to represent professional behavior and motivate students through meaningful application of the knowledge that they acquire. The design studio courses are complemented by courses in theory, history, technology, environment, and practice taught by distinguished scholars in those topics to assure that students may design from a base of extensive and comprehensive knowledge of the built environment. The Department also offers a Master of Architecture degree (M.Sc.) which was introduced in the year 1406 AH (1986/87 AD). The introduction of the doctoral program, (Doctor of Philosophy in Architecture Ph.D.), in the academic year 1425/26 AH (2003/04 AD) was a natural outgrowth of the post-graduate program. Since then, it has been the first architecture department offering such a degree in the entire Arabian Gulf region. As a pioneer of architectural education in the Kingdom and the region, the Department of Architecture and Building Sciences adopts a teaching strategy based on the following principles: -Preserving Islamic values and Saudi societal traditions, and upholding the ethics of architectural profession. This is achieved through upholding Islamic values, respecting the needs of Saudi society, and adhering to professional ethics. -Preserving the natural environment and the architectural heritage of the country. This is accomplished by adopting the principles of environmental sustainability and conserving Saudi architectural heritage. -Keeping abreast of advances in the field of building technology. This is achieved by maintaining a strong connection between academic qualifications of graduates and the advancements in the building industry and the utilization of computer technology. This strategy has been supported by a faculty of over 50 members, all holding PhD degrees in architecture from prestigious universities. They have collectively contributed to a superior learning environment, secured numerous research projects and grants for the department, and been deployed to government and private institutions to assist in national and community development. Furthermore, the strategy is supported by several laboratories and two research chairs: King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Foundation for Developmental and Housing Research chair and Prince Sultan bin Salman Chair for Architectural Heritage. Additionally, in term of community service, the Department of Architecture and Building Sciences has actively participated in national and international competitions, aligning with the Kingdom’s development goals. The department has also initiated the process of obtaining Substantial Equivalency (SE) from the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).",

                        "content": "Development of Departments The College of Science initially comprised six departments: Physics, Botany, Mathematics, Zoology, Chemistry, and Geology. Starting in the academic year 1395-1396 AH (1975-1976), the college identified the need for additional specializations. Four new fields were added: Statistics, Astronomy, Geology and Geohydrology, and Biochemistry. This expansion led to a structure of combined departments, such as the Department of Geology and Hydrology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Department of Zoology, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Department of Botany. In further pursuit of academic growth, between 1399 AH and 1401 AH, Statistics separated from Mathematics, and Biochemistry became distinct from Chemistry. Botany introduced Microbiology, while Statistics included Operations Research as a specialization in 1407 AH. This resulted in nine departments within the college. Additionally, Computer Science, which originated within Mathematics, was transferred to the newly formed College of Computer and Information Sciences. Academic System Evolution First: Group System Initially, the Kingdom’s development goals required graduates from the College of Science to possess diverse knowledge. Hence, a yearly academic group system was applied until 1394-1395 AH (1974-1975), with students receiving a general bachelor's degree in two specializations. Many graduates contributed significantly to the public education sector, where they effectively taught their dual specializations, while others worked in labs or pursued postgraduate studies. The group system entailed five groups, with students studying various basic and additional subjects across four years, progressing from four foundational subjects to specialized pairs by the third and fourth years. Second: Credit Hour System Implemented in 1395-1396 AH, this system allowed students within a single specialization to focus on chosen areas according to their interests and the Kingdom’s developmental needs. Initially, 144 credit hours were required for a bachelor's degree, which was adjusted to 136 hours by 1397/1398 AH. Course requirements were distributed as follows: This system was later modified in 1399 AH and 1408 AH to redistribute hours among college and major requirements. Third: Level System In 1412 AH, the Council of Ministers mandated the transition to a full-day academic structure, organizing courses into levels, each with mandatory courses within an eight-level framework. Each level's courses are sequential, allowing students to complete requirements and progress logically. New students complete levels one and two in their first year before selecting a specialization. Science Departments for Women The College of Science established branches within the Women’s University Center, including: Biochemistry Department : Founded in 1401 AH (1981), this branch offered a bachelor’s degree and added a master’s program in 1411 AH (1991), now with six faculty and 14 lecturers, teaching assistants, and administrative staff. Chemistry Department : Established in 1402 AH (1982) with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, it introduced a doctoral program in 1415 AH (1995), offering Inorganic, Physical, Organic, and Analytical Chemistry. It currently has 15 faculty and 17 additional staff. Botany Department : Since 1403 AH (1983), this branch has offered a master’s in Botany with specializations in Ecology, Genetics, Physiology, and Taxonomy, and later added Microbiology. The doctoral program began in 1418 AH (1998). This branch includes seven faculty, seven lecturers, one assistant, and eight technicians. Mathematics Department : Initially offering a master’s program in 1400/1401 AH (1980/1981), the department added a bachelor’s program in 1403 AH (1983) and a doctoral program in 1414/1415 AH (1994/1995). It currently has 11 faculty and 12 support staff. Physics Department : Established in 1411 AH (1991) to offer bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral programs in theoretical physics, the department includes eight faculty members and six additional staff. Human Resources Data from 1408 AH indicated that of the college’s 570 staff, 46.7% were Saudi nationals. By 1418 AH, total staff decreased to 512, with Saudi representation rising to 49.8%. A significant reduction in non-Saudi administrative staff led to an increase in Saudi representation from 53.7% to 78.4%. Faculty saw a decrease in contracted members, boosting the proportion of Saudi faculty from 54.7% to 63.3%, with departments like Botany, Microbiology, and Zoology reaching Saudization rates above 80%. Conversely, departments like Statistics, Mathematics, and Astronomy maintained lower Saudization levels, at 42.3%, 32.1%, and 20%, respectively. Educational Laboratories The transition to the current campus at King Saud University led to a significant expansion of educational laboratories, doubling or tripling their number. These facilities now house modern equipment essential for student training, enabling graduates to enter the workforce with practical skills.",

                        "content": "The Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at King Saud University's College of Pharmacy was established in 1379 AH (1959 AD) coinciding with the founding of the College of Pharmacy at the university. The Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology is the first of its kind in the Kingdom and one of the earliest in the region. Pharmacology is the science that deals with studying the kinetics and physiology of drugs on the body, to understand their mechanisms of action to maximize benefits and minimize side effects, as well as to identify contraindications and interactions with other medications. Meanwhile, toxicology focuses on studying the harmful and toxic effects of chemical substances in all their forms on the body, as well as methods of prevention and treatment. The department teaches pharmacology and toxicology courses, along with courses in physiology, anatomy, and biochemistry to both undergraduate and PharmD (Doctor of Pharmacy) students as per the program requirements. Students learn fundamental and practical concepts of pharmacology and toxicology, including how to understand the mechanisms of action of drugs on various body organs and the side effects associated with their use. Additionally, during their studies, students learn about the latest medications used to treat cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and many other ailments. The department also teaches pharmacology, toxicology, and biochemistry courses to undergraduate and graduate students from various health colleges at the university, such as the College of Medicine, Dentistry, Applied Medical Sciences, and Nursing. The department offers two specialized programs leading to master's degrees in pharmacology and toxicology, as well as a doctoral program in pharmacology and toxicology, which is the first of its kind in the Kingdom. After completing their coursework, graduate students conduct research in various specialized and precise fields, thanks to a distinguished group of faculty members with significant research and scientific expertise in cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases, liver and kidney diseases, vaccine and serology fields, biochemistry, microbiology, and more. The department aims to study drugs and their effects at the molecular level of cells, translating discoveries and inventions from compound isolation to cellular studies to animal studies and ultimately translating them into potential therapeutic mechanisms. Therefore, the main goal of offering these specialized programs is to qualify and prepare healthcare professionals with a high level of training and excellence in the fields of pharmacology and toxicology to meet the labor market needs and to supply pharmaceutical factories, bodies, and institutions in the Kingdom with master's and doctoral degree holders who contribute to the development of the pharmacy profession and enhance drug safety and research. Faculty members in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology continuously engage in pharmaceutical sciences research across various fields and specialties. The department includes members who are scientifically and research-oriented at both national and international levels. Many faculty members have received financial support for their research from both internal and external sources related to King Saud University and have been awarded prestigious scientific prizes and recognitions from top universities and institutions at both local and international levels. Numerous faculty members have published hundreds of peer-reviewed research papers in scientific journals in the fields of pharmacology and toxicology. The Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology strives to support the vision and mission of the college and university, which in turn supports the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 by preparing and graduating skilled medical professionals to serve the nation in various medical and research fields and elevate its name in global forums. To become the primary and accredited reference in the education and research of pharmacology and toxicology, aiming to improve human health and environmental safety.

The role of the supervisors at the Oleysha center is mostly administrative rather than academic. This innovative management structure was devised at CAMS as an effective means to ensure a unified academic policy-setting governance within the college for both male and female campuses who, at present, are located apart (in separate physical locations)."

Chinese is one of the world's most important languages, ancient and modern, as it carries among its folds and symbols an ancient civilization and culture. Its history extends to thousands of years BC. Its antiquity and richness are matched only by the ancient Arab civilization, which has strong links with China that originated through the land and sea Silk Road and was the trade link between China and the Arab countries, along with the entry of Islam into large parts of China. In modern times, Chinese is one of the five official languages of the United Nations, spoken by nearly a third of the world's population, and its education is widespread in various countries. China is linked to Saudi Arabia and many Arab countries with close economic, trade and political relations, as Saudi investments in China have increased, as well as Chinese investments in the Kingdom, in addition to growing cooperation in several fields, which is witnessing an accelerated development under Vision 2030 and China's \"Belt and Road\" initiative. Recognizing the importance of languages as a means of communication between people, King Saud University, represented by the College of Language Sciences, established the Department of Chinese Language to keep pace with this rapid development and contribute to the preparation of qualified scientific cadres to meet the needs of the labor market in the Kingdom. The department offers integrated academic programs that include teaching Chinese language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing), in addition to specialized courses in linguistics and translation, which enables students to acquire an in-depth knowledge of the Chinese language and culture, and qualifies them to work in various fields that require mastery of this language.",

It is an “act of fraud” that involves presenting a work under the guise of being the original product of the person who submitted it (plagiarism.org).\nAny idea that exists in a published text (whether in a book or online) is considered an intellectual property, which makes attribution a necessity.\nPlagiarism will not be tolerated.\nBased on Chapter 3; Article 14, the disciplinary regulations are applied on any case that involves cheating (including ghost-writing/plagiarism) in exams, reports, and assignments (9).\nBased on Chapter 1; Article 4, no student should use the excuse of not knowing the regulations as a justification for plagiarism in any form. The fact that such notification is being stated in the syllabus makes it legally binding (4).\nSUGGESTIONS\nIf you have any question or any doubt about plagiarism, feel free to contact your instructor. The English Department at King Saud University is equipped with qualified faculty members who can educate you about plagiarism. A simple question would save you from getting a failing grade.\nAll assignments should follow the MLA8/APA7 format. From the page numbering to the works cited list. Ignorance is not an excuse.
